# AnyHabit API — Quick Reference

One-page cheat sheet for AnyHabit **0.7.0**. For prose and full payload
descriptions see [README.md](README.md); for interactive docs open
`/docs` (Swagger) or `/redoc` on a running instance.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000        # backend started directly
http://localhost             # through the nginx container (docker compose)
```

There is **no `/api` prefix** — routes are mounted at the root.

## Authentication

Every endpoint except `/`, `/health` and `/version` requires credentials. There
are two ways to present them.

**Personal access token — use this for scripts.** Create one under
Settings → Developer, or via `POST /developer/tokens`. It does not expire
unless you say so, and it is revocable.

```bash
export ANYHABIT_TOKEN=ahb_your_token_here
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANYHABIT_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/trackers/
```

**Session cookie — what the web UI uses.** Sign in and reuse the `HttpOnly`
cookie, or send the `access_token` from the login response as a bearer token.

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"identifier":"owner@anyhabit.local","password":"anyhabit"}'

curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/auth/me
```

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Home Assistant"}'
# => {"id":1,"name":"Home Assistant","token":"ahb_...","token_prefix":"ahb_AbCd"}
```

### Webhooks

AnyHabit POSTs JSON to your URL when something happens. Delivery is
best-effort on a background thread with a 5 second timeout — a webhook can
never slow down or fail the action that triggered it. Outcomes are recorded on
the webhook so a broken endpoint is visible in the UI.

| Event | Fires when |
| :--- | :--- |
| `log.created` | An activity is logged |
| `log.deleted` | A log entry is removed |
| `journal.created` | A journal entry is written |
| `tracker.created` | A tracker is created |
| `tracker.relapse` | A relapse is recorded |
| `tracker.archived` | A tracker is archived |
| `streak.milestone` | A streak reaches 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100, 365 … |

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "event": "log.created",
  "sent_at": "2026-08-21T09:15:00+00:00",
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "data": {
    "log": { "id": 42, "amount": 30.0, "note": "morning run", "timestamp": "..." },
    "tracker": { "id": 7, "name": "Running", "unit": "Minutes", "type": "build" }
  }
}
```

Every request carries `X-AnyHabit-Event` and, when the webhook has a secret,
`X-AnyHabit-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` over the raw body. Verify it:

```python
import hashlib, hmac

expected = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
assert hmac.compare_digest(f"sha256={expected}", request.headers["X-AnyHabit-Signature"])
```

### Prometheus

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: anyhabit
    metrics_path: /developer/metrics
    authorization:
      credentials: ahb_your_token_here
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["anyhabit.local"]
```

Exposes `anyhabit_trackers_total`, `anyhabit_trackers_active`,
`anyhabit_due_current_period`, `anyhabit_completed_current_period`,
`anyhabit_logs_total`, `anyhabit_journal_entries_total`, and per-tracker
`anyhabit_tracker_streak_current`, `anyhabit_tracker_progress_percent` and
`anyhabit_tracker_impact_value`. Metrics are scoped to the token's owner, so a
shared instance never leaks one person's habits into someone else's dashboard.

## Backup and restore

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/export/?data_type=all&format=json` | Export. JSON is restorable; CSV is not. |
| `POST` | `/import/?mode=merge&dry_run=true` | Import a JSON export |
| `POST` | `/export/import/` | Same importer, at the address v1.2.0 used |

`data_type` accepts `all`, `trackers_only`, `journals_only`, `specific` and
`backup`. `backup` is v1.2.0's name for a full JSON export and still works.

```bash
# Back up
curl -b cookies.txt 'http://localhost:8000/export/?data_type=all&format=json' -o backup.json

# See what an import would do, without writing anything
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/import/?mode=merge&dry_run=true' \
  -F 'file=@backup.json'

# Actually import. Trackers match on name + category and logs on timestamp,
# so running this twice does not duplicate anything.
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/import/?mode=merge&dry_run=false' \
  -F 'file=@backup.json'
```

`mode=replace` deletes your existing trackers first and additionally requires
`confirm=REPLACE%20MY%20DATA`.

### Backup compatibility

Exports are stamped with both `format: "anyhabit-backup"` and
`export_type: "backup"`, so a file produced here restores on v1.2.0 and a file
produced by v1.2.0 restores here. `POST /export/import/` remains available as
an alias of `POST /import/` for tooling written against v1.2.0; it accepts the
same `mode`, `dry_run` and `confirm` parameters.

## Response conventions

- Timestamps are ISO 8601 in UTC. Day and week boundaries in analytics are
  computed in the caller's `timezone` preference.
- Errors return `{"detail": "A readable sentence"}`. Validation failures
  (`422`) also include a machine-readable `errors` array.

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `400` | Bad request — the `detail` explains what to change |
| `401` | Not signed in, or the session expired |
| `403` | Signed in, but not allowed to touch this resource |
| `404` | Not found |
| `409` | Username or email already taken |
| `422` | Payload failed validation |
| `429` | Too many failed sign-in attempts; see the `Retry-After` header |
